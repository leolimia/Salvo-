# The Idea 
  I habe create a front-end web application that game players interact with, and a back-end game server to manage the games, scoring, and player profiles. 
  
  1. I habe use the jQuery JavaScript library for the front-end client, and the Spring Boot framework for the Java-based RESTful web server.
